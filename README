libdkim++ is a lightweight and portable DKIM (RFC4871) library for *NIX,
supporting both signing and SDID/ADSP verification sponsored by Halon

comply with the current RFC.

This library requires CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) to compile, and
depends on openssl (which is normally shipped with *NIX distributions).
